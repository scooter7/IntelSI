User: summarize the proposal's strategy
Chatbot response: The proposal's strategy is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how Ohio University is perceived among students and key audiences at various phases of the student life cycle. This will be done through market research and lead generation solutions designed by Dr. James Vineburgh, the consultant from Shmooze. The goal is to inform institutional marketing and communications strategy, as well as policy and program development, across departments and functional areas of the university. The proposal promises to provide innovative, affordable, and sustainable solutions that exceed expectations and differentiate from other vendors. Interactive surveys have already been drafted and the project can commence immediately if selected as a partner.
