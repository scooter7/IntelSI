User: what are price proposal numbers?
Chatbot response: The price proposal numbers are the amounts of money that need to be budgeted or invested for specific components of the project, such as the annual subscription for Shmooze Software, dissemination and comparative/longitudinal analyses of research studies, the study of recent graduates, and the campus-based workshop and presentation. The range of the total investment is between $35,000 and $91,000, depending on whether the optional dissemination and comparative/longitudinal analyses are included.
