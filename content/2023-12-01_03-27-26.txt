User: what about predictive modeling?
Chatbot response: Predictive modeling is a process that involves developing a model based on historical data to predict future outcomes. In this particular case, the predictive modeling process is being used to create a model for predicting enrollment in an institution based on historical enrollment data. The model uses variables from the data, such as demographics and previous interactions, to determine the likelihood of a prospective student enrolling. The model is then applied to new applicants, providing a prediction of enrollment as well as a percentage likelihood score. This information can be used to inform recruitment strategy and prioritize outreach efforts. The cost for the predictive modeling service includes an initial development fee and a per-applicant scoring fee for ongoing predictions.
